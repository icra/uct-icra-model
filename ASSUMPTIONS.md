## Model assumptions / limitations
  - The model process is a MLE (Modified Ludzack Ettinger process).
  - Influent active biomass (X.OHO as COD) is always 0.
  - Mass of nitrifiers (MX.BA as suspended solids) is not considered into total
    solids mass (MX.T).
  - Influent S.VFA (volatile fatty acids) and X.BPO (biodegradable
    particulated, mg/L as COD) are 100% consumed (converted to biomass VSS)
    during the process (this only means that they are 0 at the effluent).
  - Influent S.FBSO (fermentable biodegradable soluble, mg/L as COD) is *not*
    entirely consumed because it depends on the HRT (fast), whereas the X.BPO
    (mg/L as COD) depends on Rs (slower).
  - The particulated fractions in the effluent (X.iSS, X.UPO, X.OHO, X.BPO) are
    0 (they all go to the wastage "Qw").
  - All CO<sub>2</sub> produced is stripped out.
  - Inorganic carbon is not included in the carbon balance over the AS reactor,
    because it is very small.
  - The volume of the solution of added FeCl3 for chemical P precipitation is
    0.
