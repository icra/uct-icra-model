## Model assumptions / limitations
  - The model is for a MLE process (Modified Ludzack Ettinger).
  - The influent active biomass (X-OHO and X-PAO as mgCOD/L) has to be 0.
  - Mass of nitrifiers (MX-BA as suspended solids) is not considered into total
    solids mass (MX-T) as it is 1%-2% of the total mass.
  - Influent S-VFA (volatile fatty acids) and X-BPO (biodegradable
    particulated, mg/L as COD) are 100% consumed (converted to biomass VSS)
    during the process (i.e S-VFA and X-BPO = 0 at the effluent).
  - Influent S-FBSO (fermentable biodegradable soluble, mg/L as COD) is *not*
    entirely consumed because it depends on the HRT (fast), whereas the X-BPO
    (mg/L as COD) depends on Rs (slower).
  - The particulated fractions in the effluent (X-iSS, X-UPO, X-OHO, X-BPO) are
    0 (they all go to the wastage streams), this means ideal settler.
  - All CO<sub>2</sub> produced is stripped out.
  - Inorganic carbon is not included in the carbon balance over the AS reactor,
    because it is very small.
  - The volume of FeCl3 solution added for chemical P precipitation is
    considered 0.
