## Model assumptions / limitations
  - The modelled WWTP process is a MLE (Modified Ludzack Ettinger process).
  - Influent X.OHO (active biomass as VSS) is always 0.
  - Mass of nitrifiers (MX.BA as suspended solids) is not considered into total solids mass MX.T.
  - Influent S.VFA and X.BPO (mg/L as COD) are 100% consumed (converted to biomass VSS) during the process.
  - Influent S.FBSO (mg/L as COD) is *not* entirely consumed because it depends on the HRT (fast), whereas the X.BPO (mg/L as COD) depends on Rs (slower).
  - The particulated fractions in the effluent (X.iSS, X.UPO, X.OHO, X.BPO) are 0 (they all go to the wastage "Qw").
  - All CO<sub>2</sub> produced is stripped out.
  - Inorganic carbon is not included in the carbon balance over the AS reactor, because it is very small.
  - The volume of the added FeCl3 solution for chemical P removal is 0.
