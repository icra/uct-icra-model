# ecoadvisor backend
Model for icra's ecoadvisor project.
Coded in pure Javascript (without GUI)

## status: under development
Steady state model by George Ekama.
Implemented by Llu√≠s Bosch (lbosch@icra.cat).

## items pending/todo/discuss/finish
- ask george if the HRT changes when using SST as wastage
- denitrification outputs (units and descriptions)
- chemical P removal (already discussed with George)
- mass of nitrifiers (MX-BA) add to MX-T
- fx1 and fx3 (fraction mass of unaerated sludge)
- add energy consumption module
- add anaerobic digestion (future)
- add stoichiometry (for CO2(air) produced) (future)

## items solved
- wastage Qw in AS (waste from reactor or sst)
- DO inhibition in nitrification
- pH sensitivity in nitrification
